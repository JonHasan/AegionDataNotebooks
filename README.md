# AegionDataNotebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JonHasan/AegionDataNotebooks/master)

 
Contains research notebooks for composite materials. For now, this includes the composite materials playground. This will be expanded in the future depending on what I come across. 

Notebooks here will cover mechanics of composites and will cover equations that provide stresses and strains for laminates with a wide variety of configurations. 

Composite Builder will allow creation of materials with attributes of the users liking and will allow user to see calculations of composite properties based off the constituent properties given by the user.
